"""Correct bad genotype calls in vcf files.

Bad genotypes are called when only a few reads support the rare variant. In
some cases, although the likelihood supports the rare variants, the individual
is being genotyped as homozygous (code 0/1). Eg:

0/1:21,3,0:1:7

will be replaced by:

1/1:21,3,0:1:7

Usage:
    ./vcf_genotype_correction.py  input_file  output_file
